# VitaSoap

Imagine an emulator... drunk. That is VitaSoap. Inspired by Vita3K (but not using Vita3K's source code), VitaSoap is an attempt to fill in the gap in the PS Vita emulation market. Do **not** expect it to work.

# ReFamos // ReX

I created ReFamos (a.k.a ReX) as an organisation which focuses on ReFamos, ReNitro and ReWii, which are all remakes of my previous projects or existing hardware. ReFamos is the CPU emulator supporting multiple ARM chips.
