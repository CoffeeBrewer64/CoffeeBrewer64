#About Me

I'm CoffeeBrewer64, a software and game developer. Over the years, I have begun working on new projects, which I've decided to share here, for everyone to have access to.

#Goals

My current goal is to create open-source software which can run on low-end devices. I believe that software and games shouldn't be restricted just to people with high-end devices with 32GB of RAM and 5Ghz CPUs.
All of my software is designed around this belief. My custom-built game engine (OnagEngine) is confirmed to run on computers with under 500Mhz processing power. That's what computers from 1999 (source 1 and source 2) used.

#Sources

I got bored, so I added sources to this. I know that no-one will ever click on them, but at least I can consider myself a bit more productive.
